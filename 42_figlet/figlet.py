CS50. Problem Set 4. Frank, Ian and Glenâ€™s Letters.

In a file called figlet.py, implement a program that:
Expects zero or two command-line arguments:
Zero if the user would like to output text in a random font.
Two if the user would like to output text in a specific font, in which case the first of the
two should be -f or --font, and the second of the two should be the name of the font.
Prompts the user for a str of text.
Outputs that text in the desired font.
If the user provides two command-line arguments and the first is not -f or --font or the second is not the name of a font,
the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.
