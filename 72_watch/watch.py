CS50. Problem Set 6. Watch Youtube

In a file called watch.py, implement a function called
parse that expects a str of HTML as input, extracts any
YouTube URL thatâ€™s the value of a src attribute of an
iframe element therein, and returns its shorter, shareable
youtu.be equivalent as a str. Expect that any such URL will
be in one of the formats below. Assume that the value of src
will be surrounded by double quotes. And assume that the input
will contain no more than one such URL. If the input does not
contain any such URL at all, return None.
