"""
CS50. Problem Set 6. Working 9 to 5

In a file called working.py, implement a function
called convert that expects a str in either of the
12-hour formats below and returns the corresponding
str in 24-hour format (i.e., 9:00 to 17:00). Expect
that AM and PM will be capitalized (with no periods
therein) and that there will be a space before each.
Assume that these times are representative of actual
times, not necessarily 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM specifically.

9:00 AM to 5:00 PM
9 AM to 5 PM
Raise a ValueError instead if the input to convert is
not in either of those formats or if either time is
invalid (e.g., 12:60 AM, 13:00 PM, etc.). But do not
assume that someoneâ€™s hours will start ante meridiem
and end post meridiem; someone might work late and
even long hours (e.g., 5:00 PM to 9:00 AM).
